# Berlin Transport Network Data Processing: From Historical Sources to Network Analysis

## Abstract

This document details the methodology developed for processing historical Berlin transport timetables (Fahrplanbücher) into structured network data suitable for computational analysis. The workflow encompasses data transcription, geolocation, enrichment, and database integration, with particular attention to data quality and historical accuracy. This process enables the analysis of Berlin's public transportation system evolution during the Cold War period (1945-1989), while maintaining the flexibility to accommodate similar historical transport network analyses.

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Project Context

The transformation of historical transport timetables into analyzable network data presents unique challenges at the intersection of digital humanities and transport history. This workflow addresses these challenges through a systematic approach to data processing, enrichment, and validation, enabling both quantitative analysis and historical interpretation.

### 1.2 Source Material

The primary sources are Berlin transport authority (BVG) Fahrplanbücher, published annually or biannually between 1945 and 1989. These timetables provide comprehensive listings of:

- Line designations
- Station sequences
- Service frequencies (at 7:30 AM, Monday-Friday)
- Transport type (U-Bahn, S-Bahn, tram, bus, ferry)
- Administrative divisions (East/West Berlin)

## 2. Methodology

### 2.1 Data Collection and Transcription

#### 2.1.1 Initial Data Capture

```python
line_data = {
    'line_name': str,  # Line identifier
    'type': str,       # Transport type
    'stops': str,      # Station sequence
    'frequency': float,# Service frequency
    'length_time': float, # Journey duration
    'year': int,       # Publication year
    'east_west': str   # Administrative zone
}
```

#### 2.1.2 Data Quality Considerations

- Manual transcription necessary due to OCR limitations with complex timetable layouts
- Standardization of station names required due to historical variations
- Missing intermediate stations in some periods requiring careful documentation

### 2.2 Geolocation Process

#### 2.2.1 Station Location Sources

1. Existing Wikidata entries (primarily for U-Bahn and S-Bahn stations)
2. Historical maps and route descriptions
3. Street intersection inference for bus and tram stops

#### 2.2.2 Location Verification

- Distance validation between consecutive stops
- Transport-type specific thresholds:
  - S-Bahn: 2.5km
  - U-Bahn: 1.5km
  - Tram: 0.8km
  - Bus: 0.5km

#### 2.2.3 Location Update Mechanism

```python
class Correction:
    """Track station location corrections."""
    timestamp: datetime
    stop_id: str
    old_location: tuple
    new_location: tuple
    source: str
    validator: str
```

### 2.3 Data Enrichment

#### 2.3.1 Administrative Data

- District (Bezirk) assignment
- Neighborhood (Ortsteil) classification
- Postal code integration
- East/West Berlin designation

#### 2.3.2 Transport Attributes

- Service frequency standardization
- Transfer point identification
- Line type classification

### 2.4 Network Model Construction

#### 2.4.1 Graph Structure

- Nodes: Stations with attributes
  - Coordinates
  - Administrative information
  - Type classification
- Edges: Connections with attributes
  - Service frequency
  - Capacity
  - Transport type
  - Duration

#### 2.4.2 Temporal Aspects

- Yearly snapshots
- Relationship tracking across years
- Service evolution documentation

## 4. Limitations and Considerations

### 4.1 Source Material Limitations

#### 4.1.1 Timetable Completeness

- Only "important" stations listed for bus and tram lines until 1975 in West Berlin
- Varying definitions of "important" stations across years and administrative zones
- Missing service information during special events or disruptions
- No information about temporary route changes or construction detours
- Limited capacity for capturing service variations by time of day

#### 4.1.2 Temporal Resolution

- Annual/biannual snapshots provide limited temporal granularity
- Major events between snapshots not captured (e.g., 1949 BVG strike)
- Service frequency data limited to 7:30 AM weekday operations
- Seasonal variations in service not represented
- Special event services not documented

#### 4.1.3 Historical Context Issues

- Political bias in reporting between East and West
- Different administrative priorities affecting data collection
- Varying standards for service documentation
- Impact of Cold War on information sharing
- Incomplete documentation of cross-border services

### 4.2 Methodological Limitations

#### 4.2.1 Geolocation Challenges
