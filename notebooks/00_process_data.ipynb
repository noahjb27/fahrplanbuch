    "# Berlin Transport Data Processing\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook performs the initial extraction and transformation of Berlin's historical public transportation data from raw sources. It represents the first step in our processing pipeline.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Purpose\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Data Extraction**: Load and parse raw data from digitized Fahrplanbücher (timetables)\n",
    "2. **Initial Structuring**: Convert raw data into structured tables with consistent formats\n",
    "3. **Station Identification**: Establish unique identifiers for transportation stops\n",
    "4. **Preliminary Geolocation**: Match stations to known geographic coordinates where possible\n",
    "\n",
    "## Process Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "The process follows these key steps:\n",
    "1. Load raw data from CSV files containing transcribed Fahrplanbuch information\n",
    "2. Process this data into standardized tables (lines and stops)\n",
    "3. Match stations with existing station records to obtain geographic coordinates\n",
    "4. Generate interim data files for subsequent processing stages\n",
    "\n",
    "## Historical Context\n",
    "\n",
    "The data represents Berlin's public transportation system during the Cold War era (1945-1989). During this period, Berlin was divided, with separate transportation authorities operating in East and West Berlin. This division is reflected in our data processing approach, where we handle each side separately for each year."
